{"name":"tweety","tagline":"use twitter through command line","body":"#Tweety\r\nUse twitter through your terminal\r\n\r\n##Installing\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install tweety -g\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n##Usage:\r\n\r\n###Initializing\r\nIdentify yourself! You'll only have to do this once.\r\n```\r\n$ tweety init\r\n```\r\nIt'll prompt you to visit a URL, that URL will ask you to identify the app on twitter, and then it'll show you a code. Back on the command line,  enter that code and the app will save your tokens on a local json file.\r\n\r\n###Sending:\r\n\r\nTo send a message, just run the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tweety someUserName \"The complete message\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Note_ that if your message is longer than 140 characters, tweety will split it into as many parts as required and it'll send all parts sequentially. I should also point out, when typing the username you're sending your message to - you do **not** need to put an @ at the beginning. If you were to send a message to me (@ImJaken) then your command would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tweety ImJaken \"Hey Jaken!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Receiving / Reading\r\n\r\nWith tweety you can do both: listing the latest 20 messages of your inbox, or reading a specific message. \r\nHere is how:\r\n\r\n####Listing inbox\r\nIn order to read the latest 20 messages of your inbox, just use the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tweety read inbox\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll get a list of messages with the id of the message, the screen name of the sender, when was it send, and a small part of the text.\r\nSomething like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--- [ Inbox ](last 20 messages) ---\r\n[403959669888401400] FROM: someUser - 11/22/2013 - 4:54:25 pm - This message is too ...\r\n[403951109326524400] FROM: anotherUser - 11/22/2013 - 4:20:24 pm - Testing short message\r\n[364477670723043300] FROM: anotherUser1 - 08/5/2013 - 5:07:03 pm - Thank you so much for followin...\r\n[352955266691657700] FROM: ImJaken - 07/4/2013 - 10:01:07 pm - Thank you so much for followin...\r\n[326768482609930240] FROM: dribble - 04/23/2013 - 3:44:11 pm - Thanks for the follow!
